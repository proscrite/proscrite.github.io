Eventually in several languages (show don't tell)
Two parallel lines:
- Science: Start with Azrieli talk embedded. Then show interactive timeline from Bachelor until now, with "milestones" or keypoints. Show different countries, institutions, projects... This will link to the different subpages in the second line
- Projects: A more classically organized page. Several subpages
     -Software: ManHatTan, Sabbath, LucidPath (part of IC), RaTag, AutostepFinder (Julia), XPS fits
     -Experiments/setups: Rita, microscopy, topology, XPS, synchrotrons, vacuum-microscope, STM, AFM, fluorometer, NEXT-100/NEW, ALI, RaMon, QCD (TFG), 3D-print
     -Outreach: Neutrino videos, next website, conferences, TUM, LSC talks, semanas ciencia alcorisa/gav√†. Posters.
     -Other projects (failed): flat prices scrapper, Detente, collab w/ Alex F. 
     -Personal: languages, music (soundscore? Fractal beaches, corral rock, piladom), sports (bjj, swim 5k), writing, trips (map visited countries)
